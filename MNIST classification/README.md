# MNIST Classification project

In this project I'm going to classify images coming from the MNIST dataset. It contains more than 60k images coming from the NIST database, they represent numbers in the range [0, 9] handwritten by students and workers. It's usually used in the machine learning field as training set for new classification systems on images.
