# Visualizing COVID-19 project
This project was made on **Data Camp** platform and it's my first project written in R language.

## Libraries
Some of the libraries used in this project are the following:
* *readr* to import the datasets;
* *ggplot2* for visualizations;
* *dplyr* for data manipulation.

I highly recommend you to have a look directly at the notebook because you will find all the infos about this project there (and lots of graphs).
